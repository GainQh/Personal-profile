## Passion for Game Development
Developing games :video_game: has been a dream of mine since I was a little kid, and I find it fulfilling to create novel gameplay and game concepts and realise them using computer technology. I have worked on several ARVR games and won several awards, I have also worked on a game project for teachers within the college, a programming puzzle game to help beginners, and I have also developed simple indie games with team members, where the models were all made by the team. In order to better realise my dream of game development, I am constantly learning how to use blender and Zbrush to create 3d models, and I am also interested in Cubase to create game soundtracks :notes: !
